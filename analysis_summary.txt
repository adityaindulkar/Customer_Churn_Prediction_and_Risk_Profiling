1. Model Performance
  Random Forest: 62% precision, 71% recall, F1-score 0.67 (threshold: 0.603)
  Gradient Boosting: 62% precision, 72% recall, F1-score 0.66 (threshold: 0.377)
  XGBoost: 60% precision, 71% recall, F1-score 0.65 (threshold: 0.614)
All models effectively identify churners (~71% recall) but with moderate precision (~62%). Gradient Boosting offers the best balance for retention campaigns. The Recall was deliberately kept high to catch most of the churners so that proper actionable measures can be applied.

2. Key Predictors of Churn
  Contract Type: Month-to-month contracts have a 42.7% churn rate (3.8x more likely to churn than 1-year customers and 15.1x higher than 2-year contracts).
  Tenure: Customers with 0-12 months tenure show 48.3% churn risk and contribute 53.5% of total churn.
  Service Type: Fiber optic users without tech support churn at 49.4%.
These key predictors were the most important features derived from the ML models trained.

3. High-Risk Customer Profile
  Customers with all three risk factors (month-to-month contract, <12 months tenure, fiber optic without tech support) have a 71.6% churn rate. This group warrants prioritized intervention.

4. Critical Insights Gained
  Month to Month and customers with low tenure more likely to churn. This directly impacts the business in the longer run down the years.
  Fiber Optic users without tech support: Nearly half the customers churn.
  Fiber Optic service needs improvement because why does the customer need tech support? If the customer needs tech support often then there is a need in improvement of the service itself. Churning maybe because of constant faults and cuts in internet service.

5. Recommended Business Actions
  Contract Incentives: Convert month-to-month to annual contracts and 2-year contracts via discounts.
  Tenure-Based Engagement: Providing special offers for customers every 3 months to award their loyalty would keep them happy.
  Service Bundling: Include complimentary tech support for fiber optic users during initial 6 months and charge a minimal fee later on.
  Targeted Retention: Assign account managers to high-risk customers for personalized retention efforts. Setup constant calling and checking in on customers in high churn risk zone to solve their problems and reduce churning

Conclusion
Focus retention efforts on month-to-month customers, new users (<12 months), and fiber optic subscribers without support. Gradient Boosting is the optimal model for identifying at-risk accounts. Proactive measures in the first year can significantly reduce churn volume and stabilize revenue.
